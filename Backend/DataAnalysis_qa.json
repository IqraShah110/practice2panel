        "question": "How does data cleaning play a vital role in the analysis?",
        "answer": "Data cleaning can help in analysis because: • Cleaning data from multiple sources helps transform it into a format that data analysts or data • scientists can work with. • Data Cleaning helps increase the accuracy of the model in machine learning. It is a cumbersome process because as the number of data sources increases, the time taken to clean the data increases exponentially due to the number of sources and the volume of data generated by these sources. It might take up to 80% of the time for just cleaning data making it a • crit ical par t of the ana lysi s tas k."

        "question": "Differentiate between univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Univariate analyses are descriptive statistical analysis techniques which can be differentiated based on one variable involved at a given point of time.  For example, the piecharts ofsales basedonterritory involveonlyonevariableandcantheanalysiscanbe referred toas univariate analysis. The bivariate analysis attempts to understand the difference between two variables at a time as in a scatt Multivariate analysis deals with the study of more than two variables to understand the effect of variables  on the responses.",

        "question": "Explain Star Schema?",
        "answer": "It is a traditional database schema with a central table. Satellite tables map IDs to physical names or descriptions using the ID fields; these tables are known as lookup tables and are principally useful in real-time applications, as they save a lot of memory. Sometimes star schemas involve several layers of summarization to recover information faster."

        "question": "What is Cluster Sampling?",
        "answer": "Cluster sampling is a technique used when it becomes difficult to study the target population spread across a wide area and simple random sampling cannot be applied. Cluster Sample is a probability sample where each sampling unit is a collection or cluster of elements. For example,a researcherwants to survey the academic performanceofhighschool students in Japan. He can divide the entire population of Japan into different clusters (citie. Then the researcher selects a number of clusters depending on his research through simple or systematic random sampling."

    {
        "question": "What is Systematic Sampling?",
        "answer": "Systematic sampling is a statistical technique where elements are selected from an ordered sampling frame. In systematic sampling, the list is progressed in a circular manner so once you reach the end of the list, it is progressed from the top again. The best example of systematic sampling is equal probability method."

        "question": "What are Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues?",
        "answer": "Eigenvectors are used for understanding linear transformations. In data analysis , we usually calculate the eigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix. Eigenvectors are the directions along which a particular linear transformation acts by flipping, compressing or stretching. Eigenvalue can be referred to as the strength of the transformation in the direction of eigenvector or the factor by which the compression occurs."

        "question": "Can you cite some examples where a false positive is important than a false negative?",
        "answer": "Let us first understand what false positives and false negatives are False Positives are the cases where you wrongly classified a non-event as an event a.k.a Type I erro•r. False Negatives are the cases where you wrongly classify events as non-events, a.k.a Type II error. Example In the medical field, assume you have to give chemotherapy to patients. Assume a patient comes to that hospital and he is tested positive for cancer, based on the lab prediction but he actually doesn’t have cancer. This is a case of false positive. Here it is of utmost danger to start chemotherapy on this patient when he actually does not have cancer. In the absence of cancerous cell, chemotherapy will do certain damage to his normal healthy cells and might lead to severe diseases, even cancer. Example Let’s say an e-commerce company decided to give $1000 Gift voucher to the customers whom they assume to purchase at least $10,000 worth of items. They send free voucher mail directly to 100 customers without any minimum purchase condition because they assume to make at least 20% profit on sold items above $10,Now the issue is if we send the $1000 gift vouchers to customers who have not actually purchased anything but are marked as having made $10,000 worth of purchase."

        "question": "Can you cite some examples where a false negative important than a false positive?",
        "answer": "And vice versa? Example 1 FN: What if Jury or judge decides to make a criminal go free? Example 2 FN: Fraud detection. Example 3 FP: customer voucher use promo evaluation: if many used it and actually if was not true, promo sucks."

        "question": "Can you cite some examples where both false positive and false negatives are equally important?",
        "answer": "In the Banking industry giving loans is the primary source of making money but at the same time if your repayment rate is not good you will not make any profit, rather you will risk huge losses. Banks don’t want to lose good customers and at the same point in time, they don’t want to acquire bad customers. In this scenario, both the false positives and false negatives become very important to measure."

        "question": "Can you explain the difference between a Validation Set and a Test Set?",
        "answer": "A Training Set: • to fit the parameters i.e. weights A Validation set: • part of the training set • for parameter selection • to avoid overfitting A Test set: • for testing or evaluating the performance of a trained machine learning model, i.e. evaluating the predictive power and generalization."

    {
        "question": "Explain cross-validation?",
        "answer": "Cross-validation is a resampling technique used to evaluate machine learning models, especially when working with limited data. It works by splitting the dataset into k groups, known as k-fold cross-validation. For example, if k=10, the process is called fold cross- validation. This method is widely used in predictive modeling to estimate how well a model will perform on unseen data, making it a reliable approach for assessing model accuracy in real-world scenarios. The procedure involves shuffling the dataset, dividing it into k groups, and then using each group once as a test set while training the model on the remaining groups. The performance scores from each fold are averaged to give an overall estimate. A variation, called Stratified k-fold, ensures that each split has a representative distribution of classes, which is especially important for unbalanced datasets. This approach provides a more accurate and less biased estimate of model performance compared to a simple train/test split."
